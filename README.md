# Wolf3d
3D Environment using raycasting.

This project was done by me and my project-partner tturto.
It is a valid and a finished project in terms of school progress, but something im still working on and adding new features.


The goal of this project was to create a program that takes a file holding 2D coordinates for a map as a parameter and renders it to a 3D environment.

# usage: 
    ./wolf3d test_map

# You can:

    move around the environment using arrowkeys

    tilt your head with 'W'/'S'
    
    show/hide 2D map with 'P'
    
    edit wall height using '-'/'+', though the program still wont draw the walls behind the initial ones, and wallcollision will still take place.
    
    exit with 'esc'

I recommend changing your key repeat and delay until repeat settings to max for fluency.

Also changing wolf3d.h declarations will change fluency and processing power.

example maps in test_maps folder.
